# Introduction

Welcome to the **BobRoss** package! This package provides a dataset and a Shiny app that allows users to analyze color data from Bob Ross's paintings in the *Joy of Painting* series. This vignette will walk you through the package's functionality, focusing on the key function `loadbob()`.

## Installation

Before we dive in, make sure you have installed the **BobRoss** package. You can install the package from GitHub as follows:

``` r
# Install the devtools package if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install BobRoss package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("ETC5523-2024/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-Raodityaaa/BobRoss")
```

## Loading

Once installed, load the BobRoss package using:

``` r
library(BobRoss)
```

Function Overview The BobRoss package includes a key function loadbob() that launches a Shiny app for exploring Bob Ross's paintings based on the colors used in each one.

``` r
loadbob()
```

This function opens the Shiny app, where users can interact with various plots to explore the color information.

## Shiny App

Once the Shiny app is loaded, you can:

-   Explore year-wise changes in color using a slider.
-   View tooltips showing color frequency.
-   Scroll through a list of colors and paintings.
-   The app provides a user-friendly interface to visualize Bob Rossâ€™s painting patterns and color choices.

## Dataset

The BobRoss package also contains the underlying dataset with detailed information on the colors used in each painting. You can access it directly for custom analysis if desired:

``` r
#Example usage
head(bobross_data)
```

This dataset contains columns such as:

1.  **season**: The season of the painting.

2.  **episode**: The episode number of the painting.

3.   **painting_title**: The title of the painting.

4.  **colors**: The names of the colors used in the painting.

This data can be used for additional exploration or analysis outside the Shiny app.

## Conclusion

The **BobRoss** package provides an exciting way to explore Bob Ross's use of color through a dataset and an interactive Shiny app. Whether you're a fan of *The Joy of Painting* or a data enthusiast looking to analyze artistic trends, this package has something for you.
